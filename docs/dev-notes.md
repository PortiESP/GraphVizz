# Examples

The examples page `/examples` contains a list of templates that demonstrate how to use the GraphVizz Tool. 

## Add a new example

To add a new example we need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare two files: 
   - The graph file as a `.json` file (can be generated by the export option of the tool) that contains the graph data. This file must be placed in the `/public/examples` folder.
   - The image file as React component (usually used as *svg* on top of the `vite-plugin-svgr`) file that represents the thumbnail of the example. This file must be placed in the `/examples/thumbnails` folder.
2. Add the example file (`.json`) to the `/public/examples` folder. The name of the file must be unique and must be the same as the `id` (*see below*) of the example.
3. Create a new object in the `EXAMPLES` array in the `Examples.js` file. The object must contain the following properties:
      - `id`: A unique identifier for the example (used above as the name of the file containing the example in the `/public` folder).
      - `title`: The title of the example.
      - `description`: A brief description of the example.
      - `thumbnail`: A JSX element that renders the thumbnail of the example
