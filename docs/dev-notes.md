# Developer notes

This file is intended to provide information that helps developers understand the project structure, how certain features work, and how to contribute to the project.

# Examples

The examples page `/examples` contains a list of templates that demonstrate how to use the GraphVizz Tool. 

## Add a new example

To add a new example we need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare two files: 
   - The graph file as a `.json` file (can be generated by the export option of the tool) that contains the graph data. This file must be placed in the `/public/examples` folder.
   - The image file as React component (usually used as *svg* on top of the `vite-plugin-svgr`) file that represents the thumbnail of the example. This file must be placed in the `/examples/thumbnails` folder.
2. Add the example file (`.json`) to the `/public/examples` folder. The name of the file must be unique and must be the same as the `id` (*see below*) of the example.
3. Create a new object in the `EXAMPLES` array in the `Examples.js` file. The object must contain the following properties:
      - `id`: A unique identifier for the example (used above as the name of the file containing the example in the `/public` folder).
      - `title`: The title of the example.
      - `description`: A brief description of the example.
      - `thumbnail`: A JSX element that renders the thumbnail of the example 


# Routes

The project uses the `react-router-dom` library to manage the routes. The routes are defined in the `App.js` file.

The header of the application is shared among all the pages. 

## Add a new route

To add a new route we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new component in the `/src/components` folder.
2. Add a new key to the `ROUTES` array in the `App.jsx` file. 
   - The key will be the path of the route.
   - The value will be the component that will be rendered when the route is accessed.


# Hamburger menu

The hamburger menu is located in the header of the application. It is used to navigate between the different pages of the application or trigger certain actions.

## Add a new menu item

To add a new menu item we need to follow these steps in the `components/header/hamburger-menu/Hamburger.jsx` file:

1. Create a new arrow function in the `HamburgerMenu` component that will be executed when the menu item is clicked.
2. Import the icon that will be displayed next to the menu item.
3. Add a new `<MenuItem>` component within the `<menu></menu>` tags. The component must contain the following properties:
   - `label`: The text that will be displayed as the menu item.
   - `onClick`: The arrow function created in step 1.
   - `icon`: The icon imported in step 2.
   - `shortcut`: The shortcut that will be displayed next to the menu item. (*Optional*)
  
*Use the previous menu items as a reference to create the new one.*


## Modal

The modal component is used by the Hamburger menu to display additional information or actions. The modal is not reusable and is used only in the Hamburger menu.

The modal is based on scenes defined in the `modal/Modal.jsx` file.

### Add a new scene

To add a new scene we need to follow these steps in the `components/header/hamburger-menu/modal/Modal.jsx` file:

1. Create a component that will be the content of the scene in `modal/scenes` folder.
2. Import the component created in step 1 in the `Modal.jsx` file.
3. Add a new key to the `SCENES` object in the `Modal.jsx` file. 
   - The key will be the id (what ever you want) of the scene.
   - The value will be the component created in step 1.

To display the new scene, we need to call the `setModal` function with the id of the scene as a parameter in the `Hamburger.jsx` file, typically on the onClick event of a menu item.
